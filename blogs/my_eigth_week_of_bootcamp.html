                From last week the solution to terrible internet gifs, let’s make our own gifs. To make the team look
                professional, I bought sweatshirts and had our logo and names pressed onto them. Then we made a
                classroom into a workout studio and recorded the workouts, wearing the sweatshirts, in order to make fun
                gifs. It was a lot of fun.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our demo was a 3-minute workout of 20-second exercises with 10-second breaks. We had the instructor say
                the magic words ‘ready’ and we were off and running. It was so much fun. We had the sweatshirts on with
                Adidas pants, we had stickers to give to the classmates that did the workout. Overall it went very well.
                I have to add a serverside API back into the website to change the grade from A to A+. I need to see if
                I downloaded the video to add to our GitHub Pages.
            </p>
            <p>
                As of today, I haven’t been able to get the server-side API finished to get the A+ but it will happen.
                Last week’s biggest lesson learned is to “Review the requirements often” if you don’t it’s the
                difference between an A and an A+. My dear friend Mae Beale is taking a course and she always brags that
                she got an A+ on every assignment. Not getting an A+ on this one when so much time went into it was a
                tough blow, but I will get it in there and I will get this A+ so I can be more like Mae Beale.

                When we started learning Node JS last week, I realized it was time to call on professional developers
                for help with my assignments. I have 3 potential tutors lined up to just work with me on assignments and
                I’m really excited for their help. As I wrote this I remembered there are two more people I could ask
                for help too. So that’s awesome.

                Side note that has nothing to do with the bootcamp but it is the reason, the server-side API is not
                completed. The Future of Healthcare Town Hall I was the lead organizer for went great. I’m putting
                together the YouTube videos for the event and learning a bit about Video Editing. So that’s exciting
            </p>
