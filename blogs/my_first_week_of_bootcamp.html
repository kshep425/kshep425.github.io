            </h4>

            <p>
                I did it, I decided to do a coding Bootcamp! I’ve been hearing a lot of things about coding bootcamps
                and thought it may be a great way to get everything pieced together in an organized way. When I do it on
                my own piecing the puzzle together of where to start and staying on track can get everything I need can
                get lost. Since I’ve had a personal goal to make the transition from automated tester to developer for a
                while it seemed like a great step to get to the next level.

            </p>
            <p>
                Therefore, I decided to attend
                <span>
                    <a class="blog_link" href="https://bootcamp.wse.jhu.edu/">
                        John’s Hopkins Univerisity’s Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp
                    </a>
                </span>
                . I’ll admit the recruiter’s persistence and constant reminders to sign up pushed me to make this
                decision. And there were some things I didn’t consider before making the leap.

                    </span> on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 6:30 PM to 9:30 PM for 24 weeks. Office Hours are 30 min
                    before class. So I should be there about 5:45 PM to find city parking and get to the classroom. Any
                    other time of day, it’s not a big deal to get on 95 North but...to get anywhere on time between 3
                    and 6 pm in Maryland I’ve learned to leave around 2 hours early. Then, you can stay after class for
                    additional help and that can be another 30 min. I’m going to dedicate 3 hours just to driving then 4
                    hours in class. So it’s a huge time commitment with the traffic being considered 2 nights a week.
                    The time commuting maybe could have been saved if I did an online course.

                        <dt>

                            I Didn’t Consider Who the Course was Geared Towards
                        </dt>
                    </li>
                    I’m not a novice to some of the concepts offered in the course, but the course is geared towards
                    novices so it can be a bit slow at times. Especially the first day when they went over how to use
                    the Command Line Interface (CLI) and called it programming. So that was a bit frustrating. There was
                    a test you had to take to be admitted to the course and I got 100% on it (yes, I’m bragging a bit)
                    but I should have listened or asked more questions when the recruiter said that most applicants
                    don’t score that high. And maybe picked a program geared more towards intermediate to advanced
                    programming skills. When I walked in I was expecting a firehose of information, it’s very
                    slow-paced, which gives me time to help others. And will be really appreciated when we start on
                    concepts I don’t already know about.
                    <li>
                        <dt>
                            I Didn’t Consider Who Would be Teaching the Course
                        </dt>
                    </li>
                    Although I asked, the staff didn’t know who would be teaching the class. And in the first few
                    classes, the instructor was reading the material from the pre-work and having us do it again. So,
                    the instructor isn’t creating the course themselves, they are using slides and activities pre-made
                    for them. Also, the instructor admittedly doesn’t work with the concepts being taught like CSS so
                    they will not be able to teach advanced level concepts of HTML and CSS. Which is too bad but I can
                    always ask the Google!
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
                So, now I can get to my insights after my first week of the course and completing all of the course
                activities and homework. During the week there were 3 lessons to go over CLI commands, HTML, CSS,
                GitLab, and Github. As I did the assignments, I ran into a few snags here and there, as expected, but in
                doing so I learned a lot and know that because of how fast-paced technology is I will always be able to
                continue to learn more.

                        It Never Works The Way You Think It Will
                    </dt>
                </li>
                Most things in my life, I look at the problem, think of a solution in my head and say to myself “I got
                this!” So that’s what I do with the homework, I look at it, research a solution, and think I can do
                that, and start putting together what I believe will be an awesome website. Then I click the “Open in
                Default Browser” and look at my HTML page and say, “Oops, that’s not right?” I’m not saying it’s
                completely off, but figuring out where those slight tweaks are that need to be made to make it work is
                where the “fun” is in programming. That challenge to get it right is really fun and when you do finally
                get it right you feel so good about yourself. Same way I felt with my math homework, when I worked on a
                problem then looked in the back of the book (yes, I went to school when they gave you books, shush) and
                saw that I had the right answer, it would make me super happy.

                        <a class="blog_link" href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3C Schools </a>is your best friend
                    </dt>
                </li>
                It feels like anything you need there is a tutorial out there for it and <span><a class="blog_link"
                        href="W3Schools.com">W3Schools.com</a></span> this first week has been the best for it. I want
                to add a table, there’s a tutorial for it. If I want to add an element that is an orange square with a
                red dotted border, W3 Schools will give you the answer. I mean it felt like any random question or idea
                I had W3Schools had an answer for it. I found CSS to be really challenging with the homework with some
                advanced concepts in CSS but they have a CSS tutorial with examples where I could try things and figure
                it out before trying it in the assignment, which I found really, really helpful.
                <dt>
                    <li>
                        Background Color Saves the Day
                    </li>
                </dt>
                Getting elements positioned correctly in your HTML page is not always obvious. But I was able to use
                background color to help me quickly recognize which element tag I was working with and play around with
                its size and position using google chrome developer tools. So, actually so far <span><a
                        class="blog_link" href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_background-color.asp">CSS
                        background-color</a></span> is my favorite property.

                        When in Doubt Google
                    </dt>
                </li>
                Whenever I <span><a class="blog_link" href="https://www.google.com">Google</a></span> a question about
                how to do something or why something is happening, it never seems like I’m the first person to have seen
                this issue. And people have put together many different ways to help you get unstuck and/or solve your
                problem. There will be relevant tutorials, in text or video formats, quickly available to you to get the
                work you need done.

                    <dt>
                        Slack Channels are Awesome
                    </dt>
                </li>
                The course required that we download and utilize <span><a class="blog_link"
                        href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a></span>. I have used it with another course and found it
                absolutely to be a great collaborative tool. Everyone in slack can help each other with any questions or
                issues with their work pretty quickly. I am on it a lot! And it can be a huge time saver if you have an
                issue because someone will get back to you pretty quickly. The instructor and TA use it in class to
                quickly share assignments with everyone, gone are the days of handing out paper! I love it. All though
                some don’t like the name because it seems like you could be slacking in slack, but I don’t find it to be
                a slacker at all, lol.
                <li>
                    <dt>
                        Time is Everything
                    </dt>
                </li>
                Having time to put into the work assignments is crucial. And not just time, uninterrupted time is
                essential. But in this day and age, having uninterrupted time is difficult so I do a lot of prioritizing
                and time management to ensure I’m getting the things I want done completed. I also know that music can
                help you to study and focus and so I’ve been trying it. My first blog is going so well because I really
                am focused. I have <span><a class="blog_link" href="https://music.amazon.com/">Amazon Prime
                        Music</a></span> and they have a <span><a class="blog_link"
                        href="https://music.amazon.com/playlists/B07RDNZ2HN?ref=dm_sh_b5a4-5666-dmcp-5ba2-b768e&musicTerritory=US&marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER">Classical
                        for Focus playlist</a></span> curated by Amazon’s Music Experts. My productivity is through the
                roof with this playlist.
            </ol>
            So these are my takeaways from my first week of Developer Bootcamp. I’m very excited to see where this can
            go. The course offers a lot of extras as well, an awesome student success coordinator that has a pet pig,
            career services, and tutoring. I plan to take advantage of all of it, create the websites and apps I’ve been
            dreaming of, and land my dream development job!
