                    From last week the solution to terrible internet gifs, let’s make our own gifs. To make the team
                    look
                    professional, I bought sweatshirts and had our logo and names pressed onto them. Then we made a
                    classroom into a workout studio and recorded the workouts, wearing the sweatshirts, in order to make
                    fun
                    gifs. It was a lot of fun.

                    I want to make an Alexa app. I’ve been asking since day one how do I do this but it hasn’t happened.
                    But
                    with the project we were assigned I got my chance. I was too excited. I wanted a 30-minute workout
                    app
                    that reads the exercises out loud and allows for voice prompt responses. I had a team of people to
                    work
                    with and they all brought strengths to the team. We split the backend work between Jacob and myself.
                    The
                    frontend work between Gregg and Mike. We were challenged to use API’s for this assignment.

                    Oh, the Weather Dashboard. I spent countless hours trying to get the weather app assignment
                    completed. I did so much research and planning to get it working the way I wanted. I really don’t
                    know why it was so hard. I was sad because of my grandmother’s passing and I had to do another
                    remote class the day of the funeral. We were assigned to our projects that day too. So there just
                    wasn’t time to waste.

                    Well, I made it through another week of Bootcamp. Yay!

                    Up to this point, we’ve learned HTML, CSS, Javascript and finished up JQuery. This week was tougher
                    because the homework was on javascript due at the end of this course but we were learning JQuery at
                    the same time...and the homework was not supposed to use any jquery. JQuery and Javascript are very
                    similar.

                    This week we covered API&rsquo;s and DOMs. &nbsp;We can not look at HTML and grab, modify, add, and
                    remove elements from a webpage. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s pretty fancy stuff. &nbsp;This weeks challenge for
                    me was time. &nbsp;I just couldn&rsquo;t get through the activities before class so it was more
                    difficult to get through them beforehand.

                    For week 3 of Bootcamp, I was out of town and had to
                    take classes remotely. &nbsp;Luckily, I was prepared and
                    had the homework and class materials available
                    beforehand. &nbsp;This allowed me to do all of the
                    activities for the week and start the homework before
                    Tuesday&rsquo;s class. &nbsp;I had the homework done by
                    the end of the trip. &nbsp;So I wasn&rsquo;t really
                    stressed about falling behind at all.

                    Wow, two weeks down 22 more to go! In week two, the last
                    class focused on more CSS, bootstrap and media queries.
                    And a LOT of time was spent on the homework. Our first
                    assignment is due this week to build a portfolio that
                    looked like a picture. I'll go over some of the
                    struggles I learned from that later. But what were my
                    takeaways this week?

                    I did it, I decided to do a coding Bootcamp! I’ve been
                    hearing a lot of things about coding bootcamps and
                    thought it may be a great way to get everything pieced
                    together in an organized way. When I do it on my own
                    piecing the puzzle together of where to start and
                    staying on track can get everything I need can get lost.
                    Since I’ve had a personal goal to make the transition
                    from automated tester to developer for a while it seemed
                    like a great step to get to the next level.
