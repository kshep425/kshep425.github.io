                        For week 3 of Bootcamp, I was out of town and had to
                        take classes remotely. &nbsp;Luckily, I was prepared and
                        had the homework and class materials available
                        beforehand. &nbsp;This allowed me to do all of the
                        activities for the week and start the homework before
                        Tuesday&rsquo;s class. &nbsp;I had the homework done by
                        the end of the trip. &nbsp;So I wasn&rsquo;t really
                        stressed about falling behind at all.

                        Wow, two weeks down 22 more to go! In week two, the last
                        class focused on more CSS, bootstrap and media queries.
                        And a LOT of time was spent on the homework. Our first
                        assignment is due this week to build a portfolio that
                        looked like a picture. I'll go over some of the
                        struggles I learned from that later. But what were my
                        takeaways this week?

                        I did it, I decided to do a coding Bootcamp! I’ve been
                        hearing a lot of things about coding bootcamps and
                        thought it may be a great way to get everything pieced
                        together in an organized way. When I do it on my own
                        piecing the puzzle together of where to start and
                        staying on track can get everything I need can get lost.
                        Since I’ve had a personal goal to make the transition
                        from automated tester to developer for a while it seemed
                        like a great step to get to the next level.
