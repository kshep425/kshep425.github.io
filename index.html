      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hi, Keisha here!  So glad you made it to my page.  A little about me, I'm an Electrical Engineering graduate of Morgan State University.  I grew up and currently live in Howard County, MD.  </p>

      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p><a href="https://www.columbiaassociation.org/facilities/columbia-archives/history/">Columbia, MD</a></p>

      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <!--Add pics and videos of travel and dance-->
      <p>I really love dancing.  If I'm dancing I'm smiling.  Any chance for a random dance party I'm in!  Plus, I can do nearly every style of dance or at least will attempt to try it.  So dancing is definitely my favorite hobby.</p>
      <p>Next would be travel!  I actually get anxious if I don't have a trip planned.  So this course is going to be hard because I'm grounded for the next 6 months... well 5 months because I go to Key West in October.</p>
      <p>When travel and dance combine that makes for a really great vacation.  For example, attending a Tango show and then dancing the Argentine Tango in a park in Buenos Aires, Argentina...that was just heavenly.</p>

      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Having money with no work necessary!  Just having a good time.  To do that would involve coding the most amazing websites and apps for work, friends, and family.</p>

      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <!--Add picture of columbia people tree-->
      <p>I live in one of the top rated places to live in America: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia,_Maryland">Columbia, MD in Howard County</a>.  Disclaimer: I grew up here so I'm very biased.</p>
      <p>But a little about the history I know from the top of my head.  Jim Rouse founded Columbia in the 60s with the merging of 3 farms on a napkin.  He wanted it to be a place that would welcome people of all races, especially people with interracial marriages.  So it's a very diverse community which I believed it was like that everywhere in America, but when I left for college out of the bubble I discovered everywhere is different from Columbia.  It's a planned community, based on villages. Each village has a community center, pool, grocery store, and school.  Then in the center of it all is Columbia Mall and the lake front.  The lake front is a place for gathering and enjoying the weather.  In the summer, they show music and host shows for free.  It's very close to Merriweather Post Pavilion which hosts lots of great festivals and shows.  It recently made the news because there was a chance Woodstock 50 would be playing there.  It also recently had a huge makeover, if you ever get to tour the backstage do it (Spoiler alert: It has a pool for the artists and their guests).  Another thing that's great about Columbia is how close it is to everything you could possibly need, with free parking!  I really appreciate that free parking and convenience after living in the DC and Baltimore.  </p>

      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>My career I've been a Systems Engineering gathering requirements, writing documentation, and testing software that the developers got to build.  To me the developers always got to do the fun stuff, I just got to write about it and test it.  Now I want to do the fun stuff!  I enjoy coding a lot because the computer can only do what you tell it to do, which is refreshing and a fun challenge.</p>
